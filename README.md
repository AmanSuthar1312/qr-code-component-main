## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 Flexbox
- Responsive design with `clamp()`, `vw`, `vh`, and `rem`
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Frontend Mentor Starter Files](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use `clamp()` to make text scale responsively
- Proper use of `flexbox` for vertical layout and centering
- How to use `vh`, `vw`, and `max-width` for consistent card scaling
- Improved understanding of layout spacing (padding, margin, border-radius)

---

## 📌 Continued Development

Things I would like to improve or expand on:

- Add animation or hover effects
- Add a light/dark mode toggle
- Try the same design using CSS Grid instead of Flexbox
